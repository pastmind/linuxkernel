This sound driver adds sound support to, at least, four different
HP6x SuperH arch machines : HP Jornada 680, HP Jornada 690, HP Palmtop 620lx
and HP Palmtop 660lx.

It was tested in all those hp6x SuperH machines.
The driver is part of mainline Linux kernel http://www.kernel.org since 2007,
so new patches on this should be sent to ALSA Linux and SuperH Linux kernel
mailing list.
