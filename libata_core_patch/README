libata polling patch

Fixes the qc timeout problem which we have
in 620/660 machines and the latest kernel (a lot
simpler than before one i did), using the 
ATA_TFLAG_POLLING flag only in two places.

This enables to use Compact Flash cards as root
disk (which is the only way to use Linux in our SuperH machines).
